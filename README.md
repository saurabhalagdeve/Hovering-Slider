Description
The project consists of an HTML file (index.html) and a CSS file (index.css). It creates a button with a "before-after" effect that changes the background color smoothly when the button is hovered over. The button text color also changes to white upon hovering.

The CSS code defines the styling for the button and the transition effect. The ::before pseudo-element is used to create a colored background that slides in from the left when the button is hovered over, giving the "before-after" effect.

Usage
Clone the repository or download the HTML and CSS files.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Hover over the "Hover Me" button to see the before-after effect.
You can also customize the colors, text, and other styles in the CSS file to fit your preferences.
